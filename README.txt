## Created using MBED online compiler
## Target is a NUCLEO ATmega controller, 7 segment display
## Additional UART control 

## The purpose has been to show the possibility of C++ OOP (or.. kindof) approach in embedded programming

# Notes:
# Use the correct pins so that the controller worked correctly
# Some timers can be adjusted, also segments can be switch off in the beginning - see comments
